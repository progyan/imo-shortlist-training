<div class="cmty-view-post-item-text">A crazy physicist discovered a new kind of particle wich he called an imon, after some of them mysteriously appeared in his lab. Some pairs of imons in the lab can be entangled, and each imon can participate in many entanglement relations. The physicist has found a way to perform the following two kinds of operations with these particles, one operation at a time.<br/>
(i) If some imon is entangled with an odd number of other imons in the lab, then the physicist can destroy it.<br/>
(ii) At any moment, he may double the whole family of imons in the lab by creating a copy <img alt="$I'$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/f/1/ff16a7e92720b003fe5e507efb28cec1a1783b71.png" width="13"/> of each imon <span style="white-space:pre;"><img alt="$I$" class="latex" height="12" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/2/7/027f4a11d6090f9eac0ce2488df6384dad1263ea.png" width="9"/>.</span> During this procedure, the two copies <img alt="$I'$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/f/1/ff16a7e92720b003fe5e507efb28cec1a1783b71.png" width="13"/> and <img alt="$J'$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/0/c/20ccae1c14c24c581b4d01c2253c3143b4c5be85.png" width="15"/> become entangled if and only if the original imons <img alt="$I$" class="latex" height="12" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/2/7/027f4a11d6090f9eac0ce2488df6384dad1263ea.png" width="9"/> and <img alt="$J$" class="latex" height="12" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/a/b/b/abb5588023cfa1ac14643e9778699f03eecc57a3.png" width="12"/> are entangled, and each copy <img alt="$I'$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/f/1/ff16a7e92720b003fe5e507efb28cec1a1783b71.png" width="13"/> becomes entangled with its original imon <span style="white-space:pre;"><img alt="$I$" class="latex" height="12" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/2/7/027f4a11d6090f9eac0ce2488df6384dad1263ea.png" width="9"/>;</span> no other entanglements occur or disappear at this moment.<br/>

Prove that the physicist may apply a sequence of such operations resulting in a family of imons, no two of which are entangled.</div>
