<div class="cmty-view-post-item-text">There are <img alt="$2017$" class="latex" height="13" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/6/1/5617f6d8def6056c5921630439d64b56cfa519ab.png" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="36"/> mutually external circles drawn on a blackboard, such that no two are tangent and no three share a common tangent. A tangent segment is a line segment that is a common tangent to two circles, starting at one tangent point and ending at the other one. Luciano is drawing tangent segments on the blackboard, one at a time, so that no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments. Luciano keeps drawing tangent segments until no more can be drawn.<br/>
<br/>
Find all possible numbers of tangent segments when Luciano stops drawing.</div>
