<div class="cmty-view-post-item-text">Consider a convex polyhedron without parallel edges and without an edge parallel to any face other than the two faces adjacent to it. Call a pair of points of the polyhedron <i>antipodal</i> if there exist two parallel planes passing through these points and such that the polyhedron is contained between these planes.
