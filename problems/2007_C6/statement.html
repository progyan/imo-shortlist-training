<div class="cmty-view-post-item-text">In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship is always mutual. Call a group of competitors a <i>clique</i> if each two of them are friends. (In particular, any group of fewer than two competitiors is a clique.) The number of members of a clique is called its <i>size</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Given that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even, prove that the competitors can be arranged into two rooms such that the largest size of a clique contained in one room is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room.<br/>
