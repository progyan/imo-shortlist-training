Turbo the snail slides along the circles in the following fashion. Initially he moves on one of the circles in clockwise direction. Turbo always keeps sliding along the current circle until he reaches an intersection with another circle. Then he continues his journey on this new circle and also changes the direction of moving, i.e. from clockwise to anticlockwise or <span style="white-space:pre;"><img alt="$\textit{vice versa}$" class="latex" height="11" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/0/c/e0c8f7231eaab766c4cffef57a648b03c9f8ef4e.png" width="71"/>.</span><br/>
Suppose that Turboâ€™s path entirely covers all circles. Prove that <img alt="$n$" class="latex" height="8" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/7/4/174fadd07fd54c9afe288e96558c92e0c1da733a.png" width="10"/> must be odd.<br/>
