We say that a triangulation is a <i>Thaiangulation</i> if all triangles in it have the same area.<br/>
<br/>
Prove that any two different Thaiangulations of a convex polygon <img alt="$\Pi$" class="latex" height="13" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/3/e/c3e77f8dac39bd44cff4ca15469c871bab27c02e.png" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="13"/> differ by exactly two triangles. (In other words, prove that it is possible to replace one pair of triangles in the first Thaiangulation with a different pair of triangles so as to obtain the second Thaiangulation.)<br/>
