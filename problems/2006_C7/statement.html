This proves the easier part of the problem. Now let's prove the converse by induction on <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><img alt="$ n$" class="latex" height="8" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/d/3/6d3f8b726378d5420223c5cb14b10f24b202b187.png" width="10"/>.</span><br/>
Call a sequence <img alt="$ 2k+1$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/d/6/fd6ad929041ae85ddc6f0b76e98deaa8bece8983.png" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="49"/> of consecutive upward and downward triangles (starting and ending with upward triangles) from the same row a "block".

There can be horizontal diamond, but there also can be vertical ones, and for them we will need to borrow upward triangles from the above row. When we finish, it is easy to conclude there will be <img alt="$ n-1$" class="latex" height="12" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/7/3/673149a23ba4295562d199482862afb9e118dc21.png" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="41"/> holes in the remaining triangle <img alt="$ T'$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/6/e/26e54f2a5190a0f9c092ac85a72fc96640de31d1.png" width="16"/> of side <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><img alt="$ n-1$" class="latex" height="12" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/7/3/673149a23ba4295562d199482862afb9e118dc21.png" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="41"/>.</span> We just need to pick up the diamonds in such a way that the induction hypothesis is respected. Call a triangle which contains a part of the base a "base" triangle. Call a triangle which contains as many holes as its sidelength "full", and one which contains more than its sidelength "deadly". We must not create "deadly" triangles after cutting the last row. It is clear a deadly triangle may appear only as a "base" triangle for <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><img alt="$ T'$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/6/e/26e54f2a5190a0f9c092ac85a72fc96640de31d1.png" width="16"/>.</span><br/>
We claim that if a block from the base contained <img alt="$ r$" class="latex" height="8" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/7/5/f759bb98187b8f7e2632c206f955a1b5a0b87068.png" width="8"/> holes, at most <img alt="$ r$" class="latex" height="8" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/7/5/f759bb98187b8f7e2632c206f955a1b5a0b87068.png" width="8"/> holes are added to the block above it after removing the last row. We do the following procedure: the space between two consecutive holes in the last row can be filed in with diamonds except one downward triangle which has to be connected with a triangle above (clearly at least one of the downward triangles can be matched otherwise there would be too many holes breaking the condition). It is is easy to verify the claim after such a conclusion. Moreover it clear that any arrangement is of the above type otherwise we would create too many holes in <img alt="$ T'$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/6/e/26e54f2a5190a0f9c092ac85a72fc96640de31d1.png" width="16"/> (between any two consecutive holes we must crate a hole in <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><img alt="$ T'$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/6/e/26e54f2a5190a0f9c092ac85a72fc96640de31d1.png" width="16"/>,</span> and if we somewhere create more it would be over). Now we claim a "deadly" triangle arises from a full triangle. Indeed, if we have a base deadly triangle with sidelength <img alt="$ j$" class="latex" height="16" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/c/c/fcc0b937e465572e82f04fe5539fc01801dc92b6.png" style="vertical-align: -3px" width="8"/> an <img alt="$ j+l$" class="latex" height="16" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/4/b/84b3586b6258f0f516c5ee928d82937817b340ba.png" style="vertical-align: -3px" width="36"/> holes we can extend it one unit downward. This triangle has sidelength <img alt="$ j+1$" class="latex" height="16" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/b/4/8b472a92886369522823d58d1e4cd8c3b87f36c9.png" style="vertical-align: -3px" width="39"/> and had originally also at least <img alt="$ j+l$" class="latex" height="16" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/4/b/84b3586b6258f0f516c5ee928d82937817b340ba.png" style="vertical-align: -3px" width="36"/> holes according to our claim. So <img alt="$ l=1$" class="latex" height="13" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/b/7/4b7a8ffa1dee03b6cd34bf8fc91145e9bbd781f7.png" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="38"/> and this triangle was full at the beginning. It only remains to manage the full base triangles, thus.<br/>
<br/>
If two full triangles of sidelength <img alt="$ k,l$" class="latex" height="16" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/1/8/318bc7a51954dc6b36d63cff7468746670fb0af8.png" style="vertical-align: -3px" width="23"/> intersect in a triangle of sidelength <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><img alt="$ m$" class="latex" height="8" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/7/d/27de2e3a6766e801784f20a06e6d3efa823f76ab.png" width="15"/>,</span> we deduce this small triangle is also full and the big traingle of length <img alt="$ k+l-m$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/9/0/e9014971fb81940afa7f41952b29ac1a75034ef0.png" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="76"/> is too. So we may do such unions unless <img alt="$ k+l-m$" class="latex" height="14" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/9/0/e9014971fb81940afa7f41952b29ac1a75034ef0.png" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="76"/> is not <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><img alt="$ n$" class="latex" height="8" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/d/3/6d3f8b726378d5420223c5cb14b10f24b202b187.png" width="10"/>.</span> When we finish, we have two possible cases:<br/>
<br/>
a) we have some non-intersecting full triangles. Then every full base triangle is contained in one of them otherwise we could still unite it with one. Applying the induction hypothesis for them we can tile the bottom rows of them with diamonds without not making them full. Completing the tiling we achieve the goal.<br/>
<br/>
b) We have intersecting triangles, but uniting them would form the big triangle <img alt="$ T$" class="latex" height="12" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/4/5/645aa68d8b1c8cc634ce387d6321d9f9652b43cc.png" width="13"/> for which we can not apply the induction step.

It means the remaining parallelogram at the top contains no hole and then it can be tiled with diamonds. The two triangles can also be tiled. Moreover any tiling tiles also the common part of sidelength <img alt="$ m$" class="latex" height="8" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/7/d/27de2e3a6766e801784f20a06e6d3efa823f76ab.png" width="15"/> completely. So we may tile one triangle, and tile the remaining part of the second. This is the desired tiling of <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><img alt="$ T$" class="latex" height="12" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/4/5/645aa68d8b1c8cc634ce387d6321d9f9652b43cc.png" width="13"/>.</span><br/>
