A <i>non-intersecting route</i> of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called <i>cyclic</i>, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.<br/>
How many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?<br/>
