<div class="cmty-view-post-item-text">On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth <img alt="$\mathfrak{L}$" class="latex" height="13" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/e/a/1eac354be940cf3a1a83d5d47fbff6be483e34c5.png" style="vertical-align: 0px" width="11"/> consisting of <img alt="$n$" class="latex" height="8" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/7/4/174fadd07fd54c9afe288e96558c92e0c1da733a.png" width="10"/> walls, each of which is an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.<br/>
<br/>
At the intersection of two walls there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.<br/>
<br/>
After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.<br/>
